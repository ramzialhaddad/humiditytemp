# Home Humidity & Temperature Monitor
Instead of buying some prebuilt subscription based spyware. Build your own network of temp & humidity sensors!

## ⚠️ Note
### This project is currently under development. It currently utilizes a pocketbase backend running on a Pi alongside this sveltekit project. I am still learning a lot and there will be crappy design choices. Feel free to make an issue to point out where I could improve.

Instructions on how to deploy this will come at a later date when this project is relatively polished.
